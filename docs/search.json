    "text": "Interactive tool for model evaluation and decision making\nThis section requires a review and feedback from Josie, Russ and Elly…………!\n\nAimUsersScopeInfrastructureFunctionalityAttributes\n\n\nDesign a methodological framework and an interactive tool for model evaluation and application by leveraging knowledge and expertise from multiple users, partners and experts to improve model performance and guide decision making.\nNote: Model refers to Species Distribution Models (SDMs) which are numerical tools that combine species occurrences (e.g., presence, presence/absence and counts) with covariates (environmental data sets related to species presence/absence and settlement) to make spatially explicit predictions of habitat suitability or species density, using a variety of algorithms.\nTool name\nSystem?? Tool??\nOnly Evaluation???\nEvaluation + decision making ??\nSpecies Distribution Models (SDMs) Evaluation and Application Tool (SDMs-EAT)\nModel Evaluation System (MES)\nModel Evaluation & Decision System (ME&DS)\nModel Evaluation and Decision Support Tool (MET-DSP)\nOthers………….\n\n\nPotential users of this tool are describe below:\n\nModelers\nModelers are usually quantitative/spatial analysts/coders experts that co-design, implement, test Species Distribution Models (SDMs). They deliver spatially explicit predictions and their associated uncertainty of multiple species within a geographic area of interest. The predictions of SDMs are usually aimed to identify species potential distribution, habitat suitability, relative density, among others.\nEvaluators\nEvaluators are taxonomic (e.g., birds) and survey experts that possess a deep knowledge and understanding of the ecology, biology and the geographic/environmental context of the species. Their knowledge allows them to review part of and/or the entire model, providing feedback to modelers.\nHowever, there are other experts that might review specific parts of the model. For instance, statisticians can review how modelers are going to treat data sets (e.g., aggregating observations) and rigor in statistical assumptions. Other modelers also can play a significant role in providing feedback on specific aspects of the models (e.g., using alternative algorithms, model tuning, etc.).\nResource managers\nResource managers evaluate information needs for multiple applications (e.g., forest management, habitat conservation, co-benefits) and the risk of implementing a specific scenario due to a certain level of uncertainty.\n\n\nPresentation\nThis tool provides the necessary means to effectively implement three fundamental stages in the modelling cycle: development, evaluation and application (see figure and description below):\n\nCase studies\nWe will evaluate SDMs for multiple species from these two projects:\n\nUpcoming version 5 (V5) models from the Boreal Avian Modelling project (BAM)\nThe Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas models (Atlas-3).\n\nStages\n1.Model development\nThe model development section provides assistance to multiple users in designing and/or uploading a model into the tool for further evaluation.\nDesigning the model\nModel design is a fundamental part of the model cycle and it should be done at the beginning of the process. The ideal situation involves the interaction of multiple users (modelers, evaluators and resource managers), discussing and finding common ground on:\n\nModel purpose(s), objective(s).\nUsers needs and expectations.\n\nThere is also important to identify and describe key technical elements of the model such as:\n\nInputs required (e.g., focal species, type of data, covariates, scale of the analysis)\nPotential analysis (e.g., data preparation, algorithms to use,\nExpected outputs (e.g., predictions, uncertainty)\nMain assumptions\n\nThis is what we might call MODEL CO-DESIGN, and we will provide guidance and forms to document and summarize this stage.\nHowever, model co-design is not always possible, that is there is not interaction among multiple users and modelers usually design the model with some relevant information. However, summarizing decisions taken in the designing stage is critical to inform further stages (e.g., model evaluation). Let’s call this SINGLE MODEL-DESIGN.\nUploading the model\nThe tool will have the means to upload information from model design.\nModel inputs, outputs and metadata can be in different formats, such as (rasters, vectors, text, tables, etc.). It requires some expertise to upload data, graphs and tables.\n2.Model evaluation\nThe tool will provide users with and interacrive environment to:\n\nReview information and provide feedback.\nStore, analyze, summarize and recommend priority actions\nTrack progress\n\n3.Model application\nEvaluating and interpreting the effect of model uncertainty for multiple decisions and applications.\n\n\nPreliminary list of tools, software and other means to develop the Model Evaluation Tool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload models (inputs, outputs, metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nWhat tools/resources could we use to get there?\n\n\n\n\nInputs, outputs and metadata from new models need to be uploaded to some repository.\nMultiple formats: Tables, figures, layers (raster, vector), text\nRepository & Server: (GC, GEE)\nSTAC Catalog for layers\nGoogle Earth Engine to display layers\nR, Quarto, Shiny app\n\n\nUpload polygons of interest (?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nExamples\nWhat tools/resources could we use to get there?\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\nLayers: (points, polygons, rasters)\n-Turn layers on and off\n-Zoom in/out\n-Sliders that link layers and graps\nGraphs:\n-Slider to select range of values, threshold\nShinny app\n\n\nEvaluators provide feedback\nWrite comments, suggestion, recommendations\nRank products\nSave evaluation temporary and resume later\nSubmit and revisit evaluation\nComments from other evaluators\nEvaluators can select areas in the layer that they may want to comment.\nObtain reports\nGoogle form like embedded in the html\n-text\n-Quantitative feedback that might have effect on model performance (thresholds, density estimates outliers, etc.)\nShiny app to select polygons, provide feedback 9e.g., a csv file with polygons Id selected by user???\n\n\nEvaluators will be able to comment on other evaluators feedback\n\nStack overflow\nGoogle form questions embebbed throughout the tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile, store and synthesize feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nExamples\nWhat tools/resources could we use to get there?\n\n\n\n\nThe model evaluation system will structure and retain expert feedback\n\nHost\nServer\n\n\nSynthesise feedback from experts\n\nAI\nMarkdown and R packages integrating data (see googlesheets4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nFor model improvement\nPriority actions to improve model performance.\n\n\nFor decision making\ne.g. forestry management,  assessments of biodiversity co-benefits, cumulative effects, impacts, and other decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatially explicit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nThe tool consists of modules and sub-modules responsible for specific functionality.\nThis approach promotes the development, maintenance and integrity of all parts of the tool.\nA module for loading a model\nA sub-module to display layers (predictions, uncertainty, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpandable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nIt allows  scalability, responding to users needs..
