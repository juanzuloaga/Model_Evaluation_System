## Presentation

This section provide some guidance for summarizing information about model development, in particular the designing stage.

Designing a model is a key step in the cycle because allows multiple users and partners to identify the purpose(s) and objective(s) of the model, and also to explicitly share their needs and expectations (we call this ***The context***), incluiding also the species of interest (e.g., single, multiple focal species, etc.), and the geographic area of interest (e.g., national, jurisdictional, etc.).

***The context*** is a high level conversation among potential users aimed to envision the desired utility of the final product. It is the opportunity to distill multiple users' needs and expectations into common ground achievable purpose(s) and objective(s).

The second part in designing a model is setting the stage of what is feasible to implement. That is, identifying key technical elements for its implementation. For instance, inputs required, analysis to perform, and outputs expected (we call this ***The technical component***).

Summarizing *The context* and *The technical component* in this stage provide transparency and effective communication among multiple users. It will also facilitate model evaluation and further actions and applications. Consider these two items the **Metadata** of your project.

Remember, the ideal situation to design the best feasible model option(s) involves the interaction of multiple users (modelers, evaluators and resource managers) .

## The context

::: panel-tabset
## Purpose(s) & Objective(s)

Identifying the purpose(s) and objective(s) will help multiple users and partner to understand why models are developed for. For instance, we might required models to identify priority areas for conservation, inform forest management activities, predict range expansion/contraction due to climate change and land use change, etc.

In doing so, users might also have different needs and expectations that need to be documented.

Finally, main assumptions, limitations and potential opportunities that might affect expected outputs must be documented.

It is necessary to finalize the exercise by identifying and defining a common purpose & achievable objective(s). See 'Summary' tab.

**Task**: *Identify and define a common purpose & objective(s).*

## Geographic area of interest

Is it necessary to circumscribe model implementation to a particular geographic area? if so, what is the rationale?

## Summarizing

Here we summarized this section (purpose(s), objective(s), species, geographic area) into an actionable context. For instance,.......

The [BAM V5 models](https://borealbirds.ca/new-canada-wide-land-bird-density-estimates-version-4-0/) were produced for the purpose of modelling the distribution and abundance of 143 breeding birds in the boreal forest across Canada. The primary purposes of the models are to accurately map the distribution of bird density on the landscape and sum those predictions to estimate population size.
